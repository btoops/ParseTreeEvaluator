Project made using CLion IDE, can run using command prompt and entering "gcc main.c -o main.exe" and then running "main.exe" or cmake cMakeLists.txt


The Program first prompts for the input for the recursive decent parser,
constructs the tree for the recursive decent parser, 
prints the answer to the arithmetic expressions,
then constructs the tree for the table driven parser on the same input, 
and then prints the answer to the arithmetic expression.

When "quit" is entered, the program quits.
